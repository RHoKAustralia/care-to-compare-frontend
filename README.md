# CareToCompare? front end

### Overview

This project aims to continue of one of the projects initiated by a Roberto Pietrobon, a changemaker from Random Hacks of Kindness.  The goal of CaretoCompare? is to inform users of different health insurance from different providers so that they can decide better which one suits them.

### Reasons for choosing this project
* The project is done in React.JS which I prefer to learn more for my last project.

* The project allows me to focus on the front end aspect and in the future use the search api from https://github.com/RHoKAustralia/care2compare-search-api, which will be developed using Java by other volunteers. Moreover, there is already a mockup which I can follow.

* Working on the project allows me to learn more on the technologies, libraries used during the hackathon as I can see from the code how they were used and improve the project as it was dun in a rush.

* Lastly, I can continue working on it afterwards as the project progresses.

### Technologies used

* React.JS and packages used-- react-router, react-social-icons, [react-materialize](https://github.com/react-materialize/react-materialize), [material-ui](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui),[react-slick](https://github.com/akiran/react-slick)

* Javascript

* HTML

* CSS

###  Accomplished
* Added footer component
* Updated the styling of the first three pages (Landing, Details, Search)

### Other tasks

- Nice to have: implement a nice slider for displaying policy results in Search Result page (there was an error from library in getting element height and it needs further investigation)
- More styling and polishing needs to be performed to follow the mockup.
- Consult with UX designers if the use of Google's Material Design / Materialize is ok user experience.
- Ask UX designers more details about the icons, fonts, colors.
